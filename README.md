# 📌 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
KPI 1: Average Temperature (°C)
•	Value: ≈ 22.7°C
•	Meaning: Shows the overall climate condition across Indian cities.
•	Use case: Helpful for tourism planning, seasonal product demand, and energy usage forecasting.

KPI 2: Hottest City (Maximum Temperature)
•	City: Solapur
•	Temperature: 31°C
•	Meaning: Identifies heat-prone regions.
•	Use case: Useful for heatwave alerts, water consumption planning, and cooling product sales.

KPI 3: Average Humidity Level (%)
•	Value: ≈ 38.7%
•	Meaning: Indicates overall moisture level in the air.
•	Use case: Important for health advisory services, agriculture, and HVAC businesses.

KPI 4: City with Highest Wind Speed
•	City: Chennai
•	Wind Speed: 19 km/h

# ❓ Business Analysis Questions (Simple to Moderate)
1.	Which cities experience above-average temperatures, and how many such cities are there?
→ Helps identify heat-risk zones.

2.	Is there a relationship between humidity and visibility across cities?
→ Useful for pollution and fog prediction analysis.

3.	Which regions show high wind speed but low humidity?
→ Good candidates for renewable wind energy projects.

4.	Do coastal cities have higher humidity compared to inland cities?
→ Helps in climate pattern classification.

5.	Which cities have low visibility despite low precipitation?
→ May indicate pollution or dust-related issues.
